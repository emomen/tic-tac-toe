# tic-tac-toe ⁣❌⭕
This is a 3 player version of tic-tac-toe constructed as a full stack application. It uses Websockets for communication between the client and server. The backend is built in Python and uses Flask, while the frontend is written in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The application is available on [Heroku](https://csub.herokuapp.com). FYI: There must be 3 instances of the app open for a game to start. Additional instances of the app can spectate the game.
